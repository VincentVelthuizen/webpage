# Vincent Velthuizen

I am Vincent Velthuizen, enthousiastic about my family, mountains and code.
I am not able to share everything I work on, but below are some of the things I am proud of.

## MENACE

when teaching about machine learning I usually introduce students to MENACE either in Python or Java

## Learning Community for Programming (LCfP) Projects

Students of mine created this game for teaching elementary school children about logistics
